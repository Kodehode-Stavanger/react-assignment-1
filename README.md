# React Assignment 1

### Social Media Feed

![goal]("./src/assets/goal.png")

You are making a mockup of a social media feed 👍 I have included the data in the assets folder (posts.js). Leave it where it is, and import it where needed. You have to loop over the data. (Hint: use .map())

Use this component structure:

`App
⤷ Feed
⤷ Post`

This means that App will render the Feed component, and Feed will render the Post components.

I have included an image, goal.png in the assets folder to show what we're aiming for.

Ask me or your fellow students if you have any questions, good luck!
